title:  "Why One Community Member Switched from Arduino to the ARMstrap Eagle"
---
> "I came over to ARMstrap from Arduino because I was growing increasingly frustrated with the IDE and toolchain. Don't get me wrong, I love Arduino and how it's enabling beginners to really get their hands dirty in electronics and programming without needing to know the ins and outs of using a compiler or flashing an MCU, but when you move from trying to learn how something works or doing a few simple routines to trying to use advanced features of a specific chip, it can start to get cumbersome." // Hoss, ARMstrap community member
