We were recently featured on the front of [Slashdot][1] and then got picked up by [Hacker News][2].

[![Armstrap on Slashdot](/img/posts/2015/04/slashdot-video-thumbnail.png)](http://hardware.slashdot.org/story/15/04/07/1837249/armstrap-claims-to-make-arm-prototyping-easier-video?continuous_video=1#ooid=NnYnZjdDrAEMtaUyMcf_UqgmKRmkKvmn)

Despite the barrage of hits that came to the site, armstrap.org never suffered an outage.  This is in part thanks to our site being hosted on [Github][3] via [Github Pages][4].

Thank you also goes out to the team at VOV Technology, who successfully build the boards corresponding to the orders that came shortly afterwards.  Many people don't realize that VOV is experimenting with build-to-order boards.  That is, there are no stockpile of already-made ready-to-ship Armstrap boards.  The boards are built, tested and shipped as they are ordered.

We will be spending the next few weeks improving our documentation and getting-started experience, particularly on the Windows platform.  Thank you to everyone who gave feedback in the [community][5].
