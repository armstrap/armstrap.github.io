One user gave us feedback that we should consider including an [Armstrap Eagle][1] pinout diagram card in the shipment box.  You asked, we delivered.  Effective immediately (until supplies last), all Armstrap Eagle shipments will include a small card that outlines the board's pinout.  It's just another way we are improving ourselves.

If you already have your Armstrap Eagle board and you don't have the pinout diagram card, you can get the pinout in the [documentation section][2].

If you have feedback, let us know.  We have a [community section][3] where makers and entrepreneurs just like you can share their ideas and help make the site better for everyone.

Thumbs up to [Vistaprint][4] for the great quality and speedy turnaround time.
