**Compatible with Apple Mac OSX, Ubuntu Linux, and Microsoft Windows**

By integrating the JTAG board with the ARMstrap OX, Linux, Mac and Windows users can flash and debug their ARM project without the need of an external JTAG adapter.  The ARMstrap OX enumerates as a serial device, freeing the user from needing to install an expensive, proprietary driver.

**Onboard JTAG gives you fast, raw resource access**

Integration between the 168 MHz ARM Cortex M4 processor and a popular open-source JTAG implementation called the Black Magic Probe from [Black Sphere Technologies][1] makes debugging easy.

**Maker / Entrepreneur Friendly**

The ARMstrap OX uses 0805-sized SMT components and has a breadboard-friendly layout, allowing for quick and easy prototyping.  Schematics and board layout files are always open-source and free to use for any purpose.
